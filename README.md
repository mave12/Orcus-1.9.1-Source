Build

    Set the build option to Release
    Press Ctrl + Shift + B to build the complete solution (do this until it does nothing if you build)
    Set the build option back to Debug
    Press Ctrl+ Shift + B again
    At first, start Schnorchel.Server. Here, you have to enter an ip address and a port. Remember it! (127.0.0.1:10134 is recommended for tests)
    Second, modify the debug options for the Schnorchel. Go to Schnorchel.Config and set the port/ip address to that you have entered above. Make sure that you are in debug mode! (in debug mode, the Schnorchel is friendly and doesn't do anything expect the commands)
    Last, start Schnorchel.Administration and connect to the server (again with the ip/port)


    make license.orcus in the orcus admin ordner
